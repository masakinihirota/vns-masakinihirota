An update to ForwardRef(LinkComponent) inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).

When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into act(...):

act(() => {
  /* fire events that update state */
});
/* assert on the output */

This ensures that you're testing the behavior the user would see in the browser. Learn more at https://react.dev/link/wrap-tests-with-act

 FAIL  src/components/work-continuous-rating/work-continuous-rating/work-continuous-rating.test.tsx > WorkContinuousRating UI > should render rating screen when session is active
Error: expect(received).toHaveNoViolations(expected)

Expected the HTML found at $('div[role="progressbar"]') to have no violations:

<div class="mb-8" role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="10" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100">

Received:

"ARIA progressbar nodes must have an accessible name (aria-progressbar-name)"

Fix any of the following:
  aria-label attribute does not exist or is empty
  aria-labelledby attribute does not exist, references elements that do not exist or references elements that are empty
  Element has no title attribute
